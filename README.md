# Transcriptomics in yeast
### A computational bioinformatics dataset with 92 sets of yeast data on 6000 genes
Yeasts (saccharomyces cerevisiae) are used in the production of beer, wine, bread and many other biotechnology applications such as creating complex pharmaceuticals. 

Yeasts are great model organisms for for their small genome consisting of ~ 6000 genes. They are also single cells making them more homogeneous in gene expression.

We will be using RNA expression for yeasts grown in various stress conditions. We will be unraveling the genetic mechanisms involved in stress with the overal aim in using this knowledge for studying other diseases. Expression levels were normalized by TPM (transcripts per million), following a default normalization procedure.
