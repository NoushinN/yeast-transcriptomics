# Transcriptomics in yeast

Yeasts (saccharomyces cerevisiae) are used in the production of some of the most cherished food choices such as beer, wine, and bread. There are many other biotechnology applications not limited to complex pharmaceuticals. Yeasts are great model organisms for their simple and small genome consisting of approximately 6000 genes. They are also single cell organisms making gene expression more homogenous.


### Data
The dataset in this project consists of gene expression levels for 92 yeast strains treated with various stimuli. RNA expression levels are normalized to TPM (transcripts per million), following a default normalization procedure. Data is stored in `data` folder.

### Goal
The goal of this project is to unravel the genetic mechanisms involved in yeast stress adaptation through building an interactive visualization platform (e.g. shiny application or dashboard) that allows scientists to explore the data more easily. 


### Skills
You will need an introductory knowledge of RNA expression analysis workflows, design thinking, and coding skills. Coding in R or Python is an asset.
